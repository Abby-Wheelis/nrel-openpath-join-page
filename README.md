## Development

We use docker images for the software dependencies since we will not be modifying them here.

So the steps are:

#### Launch dev environment

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml  up
...
```

#### Test the frontend install

Go to http://localhost:3274/ to see the front-end. Note that the port is *3274*
instead of the *8080* in the logs, since we remap it as part of the docker-compose.
